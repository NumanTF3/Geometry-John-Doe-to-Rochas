this is just a silly lil script that converts geometry john doe into rochas

whats done :
1. player model (the original one from old forsaken)
2. animations
3. spikes
4. trail
5. intro text
6. intro cutscene geometry john doe

whats not done :
1. digital footprint (its supposed to be the stock john doe one)
2. the particles around the corrupt energy spikes

also stopping it mid game breaks john doe for that round lol but its stil very playable yk

loadstring:

```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NumanTF3/Geometry-John-Doe-to-Rochas/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()```
