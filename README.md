this is just a silly lil script that converts geometry john doe into rochas

whats done :
1. player model
2. animations
3. spikes
4. trail
5. intro text

whats not done :
1. digital footprint
2. intro cutscene geometry john doe
3. the particles around the corrupt energy spikes
4. some player model bugs and some things missing

also stopping it mid game breaks john doe for that round lol but its stil very playable yk

loadstring:

```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NumanTF3/Geometry-John-Doe-to-Rochas/refs/heads/main/main.lua"))()```
